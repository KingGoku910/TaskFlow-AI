# Supabase Migration Checklist Execution Log

## Step 2: Data Logic Migration

### Actions Completed:
- [x] Created Supabase CRUD actions for Tasks, Subtasks, Notes, Users, Meeting Summaries, Analytics
- [x] Remove all Firebase/Firestore imports and logic
- [x] Refactor all CRUD operations in backend/data logic files to use Supabase
- [x] Fixed database constraint violations (TaskStatus and TaskPriority alignment)
- [x] Added username field to users table via migration
- [x] Updated signup form to include username field
- [x] Updated signup action to create user profiles with username
- [x] Updated tutorial tasks to use personalized usernames
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors related to task type changes
- [x] Successfully built and deployed application

### Recent Updates (July 14, 2025):
- **Database Schema:** Added username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE column to public.users table
- **Authentication:** Updated signup flow to capture and store username during registration
- **Tutorial System:** Personalized tutorial tasks now use username (e.g., "Welcome to Effecto TaskFlow, [username]!")
- **Type System:** Aligned frontend types with database constraints (lowercase values)
- **Error Resolution:** Fixed TaskStatus ('todo', 'in_progress', 'completed') and TaskPriority ('low', 'medium', 'high') mismatches

### Migration Applied:
```sql
-- Migration: 20250113140000_add_username_to_users.sql
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_username ON public.users(username);
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.users.username IS 'Unique username for user identification and personalization';
```

### Next Actions:
- [ ] Test complete user signup flow with username
- [ ] Test tutorial restart functionality with personalized tasks
- [ ] Verify kanban board colors are working with new type system
- [ ] Test meeting summaries with authentication fixes
